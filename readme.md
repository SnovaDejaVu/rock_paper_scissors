Rock paper scissors  is a hand game, usually played 
between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shape
with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat
hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).
